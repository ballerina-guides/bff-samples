# Expose Real-time Data using WebSockets

Modern web and mobile app users expect real-time updates, whether it's tracking a cab's live location or viewing up-to-the-minute inventory levels. In-app chat functionality with sales agents or colleagues has also become a common feature. WebSockets emerge as the ideal technology for these real-time data transfers between front-end and back-end systems. 

Ballerina offers robust support for WebSockets, allowing services to be easily exposed over WebSocket connections. JSON-based WebSocket data is automatically mapped to Ballerina records, enabling simplified data processing. This comes with enterprise-ready security features like TLS, mutual MTLS, and OAuth2, ensuring authenticated and authorized streaming data transfers.
